Usage

  Usage: diagslave [OPTIONS] [SERIALPORT]
  Arguments:
  serialport    Serial port when using Modbus ASCII or Modbus RTU protocol
                COM1, COM2 ...                on Windows
                /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyS1 ...    on Linux
  General options:
  -m ascii      Modbus ASCII protocol
  -m rtu        Modbus RTU protocol (default)
  -m tcp        MODBUS/TCP protocol
  -m udp        MODBUS UDP
  -m enc        Encapsulated Modbus RTU over TCP
  -o #          Master activity time-out in seconds (1.0 - 100, 3 s is default)
  -a #          Slave address (1-255 for RTU/ASCII, 0-255 for TCP)
  Options for MODBUS/TCP:
  -p #          TCP port number (502 is default)
  -c #          Connection time-out in seconds (1.0 - 3600, 60 s is default)
  Options for Modbus ASCII and Modbus RTU:
  -b #          Baudrate (e.g. 9600, 19200, ...) (19200 is default)
  -d #          Databits (7 or 8 for ASCII protocol, 8 for RTU)
  -s #          Stopbits (1 or 2, 1 is default)
  -p none       No parity
  -p even       Even parity (default)
  -p odd        Odd parity
  -4 #          RS-485 mode, RTS on while transmitting and another # ms after
  Options for Modbus RTU:
  -f #          Tolerance for inter-frame gap detection in ms (0-20)
